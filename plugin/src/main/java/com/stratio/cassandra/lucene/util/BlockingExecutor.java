/**
 * This class is a specialized extension of the ThreadPoolExecutor class.
 *
 * Two functionalities had been added to this subclass. 1) The execute method of the ThreadPoolExecutor will block in
 * case the queue is full and only unblock when the queue is dequeued - that is a task that is currently in the queue is
 * removed and handled by the ThreadPoolExecutor. 2) Client code can await for the event of all tasks being run to
 * conclusion. Client code which actively chose to wait for this occurrence should call await on the instance of his
 * ThreadPoolExecutor. This differs from awaitTermination as it does not require any call to shutdown.
 *
 * This subclass of ThreadPoolExecutor also takes away the max threads capabilities of the ThreadPoolExecutor superclass
 * and internally sets the amount of maximum threads to be the size of the core threads. This is done since threads over
 * the core size and under the max are instantiated only once the queue is full, but the BlockingExecutor will block
 * once the queue is full.
